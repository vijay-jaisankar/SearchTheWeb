Collection of projects involving basic web scraping

Project1:
The user enters an absolute URL, and the program writes its HTML code into a new file, which the user can review.
Uses BeautifulSoup and Requests in Python.
Exceedingly Basic, but this data can be processed, which will be the basis for future projects in the repository.


Project2:
This checks if an Amazon Product is below an entered budget; and will send an e-mail to an entered e-mail ID if true. If not, it displays a message; this cycle is repeated everyday.
Uses bs4, requests and some basic SMTP. There are many intricacies and pitfalls in this project,so I have tried my best to include those in comments; improvements gladly accepted.
